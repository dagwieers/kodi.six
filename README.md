# Kodi Six

Kodi Six is an experimental library created to simplify porting Kodi Python
addons to Python 3.

## Rationale

The current Kodi Python API that is based on Python 2.7 handles string data
inconsistently. Some functions accept non-ASCII strings only as `str` objects
encoded in UTF-8, while other functions and methods accept both `str` and
`unicode`. Also, most functions and methods that return text data return `str`
objects also encoded in UTF-8, but a few of them return `unicode`.
This makes addon developers use *ad hoc* solutions for each case. For example,
strings that are passed to `xbmc.log()` function need to be checked if they are
`unicode` objects and, if yes, encoded to `str` using UTF-8.

In test Kodi builds with Python 3 interpreter Kodi Python API functions and
methods accept and return text data only as Unicode strings
(`str` type in Python 3) so the previously mentioned *ad hoc* solutions
won't work. For example, in Python 3 `xbmc.log()` won't accept UTF-8 encoded
`bytes` strings.

Kodi Six wraps Kodi Python API functions and methods to normalize string
handling in Python 2. All wrapped functions and methods that receive string
arguments accept both `unicode` and UTF-8 encoded `str` objects, and those that
return string data return `unicode`. This eliminates the need to use *ad hoc*
string encoding and decoding because now those functions and methods behave
similarly in Python 2 and 3 Kodi API.

In Python 3 those wrappers do not do anything.

## Important Notes

* Kodi Six is an experimental library, so issues may happen in specific cases.
* Kodi Six wrappers normalize only string arguments and return values.
  They do not touch strings inside containers like Python lists and dictionaries
  that are passed to and received from Kodi API functions and methods,
  but containers can contain both `str` and `unicode`, so in most cases
  they do not require special treatment.

## Usage

Add `script.module.kodi-six` to your addon dependencies:
```xml
<requires>
  ...
  <import addon="script.module.kodi-six" />
</requires>
```

In your addon simply import necessary Kodi API modules from `kodi_six` package:

```python
from kodi_six import xbmc, xbmcaddon, xbmcplugin, xbmcgui, xbmcvfs
```

## Example

Python 2:
```python
# coding: utf-8

import xbmc
import xbmcaddon

addon = xbmcaddon.Addon()
# path is returned as str and needs to be decoded to unicode
path = addon.getAddonInfo('path').decode('utf-8')  # This will break in Python 3!

some_string = u'текст українською мовою'
# xbmc.log won't accept non-ASCII Unicode
xbmc.log(some_string.encode('utf-8'))  # This will break in Python 3 too!
```

Python 2 and 3:
```python
# coding: utf-8

from kodi_six import xbmc, xbmcaddon

addon = xbmcaddon.Addon()
# No need to decode the path, it is already unicode
path = addon.getAddonInfo('path')

some_string = u'текст українською мовою'
xbmc.log(some_string)  # No need to encode the string
```

## Known Issues

* In Python 3 `xbmcvfs.File.read()` can read only textual files in UTF-8
  (or pure ASCII as a subset of UTF-8) encoding.
  For binary (non-textual) files use `xbmcvfs.File.readBytes()` instead.
  Textual files with encodings other than UTF-8 should be read as binary
  files and decoded using the appropriate encoding:
  
  ```python
  from contextlib import closing
  from kodi_six import xbmcvfs

  with closing(xbmcvfs.File('/path/to/my/file.txt')) as fo:
      byte_string = bytes(fo.readBytes())
  text_string = byte_string.decode('utf-16')
  ```
* `xbmcvfs.File.write()` accepts both `str` and `bytearray` arguments.
  However, in Python 3 `str` represents a Unicode string, so a sequence of
  bytes can only be passed as `bytearray`. If you are passing
  a byte string (`str` in Python 2 or `bytes` in Python 3) to
  `xbmcvfs.File.write()` you should use `bytearray` for portability:
  ```python
  from contextlib import closing
  from kodi_six import xbmcvfs
  
  text = u'текст українською мовою'
  # Works both in Python 2 and 3
  with closing(xbmcvfs.File('/path/to/my/file.txt', 'w')) as fo:
      fo.write(bytearray(text.encode('utf-8')))
  ```

## Utility Functions

Kodi Six also provides convenience conditional functions for string encoding
and decoding for cases when some API require/return `str` (bytes) in Python 2
and `str` (Unicode) in Python 3. Those functions can be used to normalize string
handling in both Python versions.

```python
# coding: utf-8

from kodi_six.utils import py2_encode, py2_decode

spam = u'спам'

b = py2_encode(spam)  # Encode Unicode to str only in Python 2

u = py2_decode(b)  # Decode str to Unicode only in Python 2

# In Python 3 the Unicode string is not changed.
```
